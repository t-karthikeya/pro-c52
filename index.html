                    <I> Origami as an art reaches back thousands of years. “Origami is really almost as old as paper,” Ms. Zeichner explained — it means “to fold paper” in Japanese — and paper in sheet form is thought to have been invented in China around 105 A.D. ... When it dries, the paper stiffens.</I>

                    <I> At its essence, origami is the traditional Japanese game of folding elaborately designed paper into a myriad of shapes, typically plants, animals, and other living things. ... Part of what makes origami unique is the fact that it simply requires a piece of paper and a creative imagination</I>

                    <I> Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China. It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather.</I>

                     <I> Origami helps develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and mental concentration. Use of the hands directly stimulates areas of the brain. ... Paper folding challenges us at the cognitive level as we follow instructions, learning new skills and activities. Physically our hands become active.</I>
